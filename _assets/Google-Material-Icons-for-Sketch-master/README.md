Google Material Icons for Sketch is a Google icon set for Sketch App. These are originally from Google library, which I'll try to keep updated.

## File fixes and improvements:

A HUGE Thanks [imaaronjames](https://github.com/imaaronjames) and [jpwain](https://github.com/jpwain) for improving the structure & organization of the file!

####Sketch file updates:

####v1.1 - Improved structure & organization by [imaaronjames](https://github.com/imaaronjames)
* Removed nested folders
* Removed all masks and clipping groups
* Consolidated all paths into one compound path per icon
* Consistently renamed all folders, icons, bounds, and paths to match Material Icons
* Reordered canvas from A-Z
* Reordered layers from A-Z

####v1.2 - Improved info and coordinates by [jpwain](https://github.com/jpwain)
* Moved the artboards to start at 0,0 coordinate.
* Added an _About artboard
* Added a version string for the file (because it varies from the Google release number) to the About artboard.
* Set file version to 1.2, tentatively, calling [@imaaronjames](https://github.com/imaaronjames) update 1.1.
* Added github project URL to the About artboard.

####v1.3 - Improved pixel perfection and scalable aspect ratio
* Fixed icons size where sometimes, could be slightly off the pixel grid
* Locked aspect ratio in order to keep scalable icons consistent

####v1.4 - Minor icons updates
* Some of the the icons found at the official Google Material Icons website, don't match the .svg/.png files, when downloaded. (i.e. ic_person_pin, and almost every ic_sentiment); I've manually fixed them. You can still find the "outdated" versions of those same icons in the file.
* ic_photo_filter updated
